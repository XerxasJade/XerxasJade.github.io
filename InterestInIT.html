							<p> <h2>What is your interest in IT & When did it Start?<br
							/></h2> My interest in IT has been developing for years, I first
							got interested during high school when the PC I used for my
							homework broke and one of my classmates taught me how to rebuild
							it. From there I started building my own gaming machines and got
							heavily into gaming and 3d modeling and making mods for games. I
							played around with 3ds in my spare time making ship models for
							games such as Freelancer and X-Wing Alliance. At school I decided
							to do both my CCNA and Aries A+ which helped me get a job at my
							current employer. Once I got a full-time job, I ended up doing a
							lot of networking and spreadsheet work and have spent a lot of
							time writing macros in excel. I havenâ€™t had a great opportunity to
							further my PC programing skills since school focusing entirely on
							networking equipment and I miss making small apps and
							programs.</p>

							<p> <h2>Why did you choose RMIT??<br /></h2> I chose to study at
							RMIT because of the positive reviews on OUA, I was looking for a
							flexible way to get back into studying IT in the hope of changing
							careers or furthering my job and OUA seemed a good way to do that
							without leaving work. I did a lot of research while deciding if I
							would go ahead and as part of that research, I found RMIT had very
							positive feedback and based off of that feedback decided to
							register to study at RMIT through OUA.<br /> </p>

						<p> <h2>Why do you expect to learn??<br /></h2> I am hoping that
						through the course of this study I can narrow down what part of IT I
						would like to focus on. I have always been drawn to programing but
						there are so many different languages and types of programing that I
						am not across. I really hope that this course will help me gain a
						better understanding of what direction I want to specialize in while
						also picking up the fundamentals and a broad basic understanding of
						the industry.<br /> </p>
