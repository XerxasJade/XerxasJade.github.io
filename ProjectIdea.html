															<p> <h2>Project Idea <br /> Modular ECU / BCU for
															Motorsport<br /></h2> <h3>Overview</h3> My project
															is to create a modular ECU (engine control unit)
															/BCU (body control unit) to improve affordability
															for entry level competitors in motorsport, while
															being scalable for more advanced motorsport teams.
															This would be used for performance tuning
															applications. The device would support having
															multiple inputs and outputs of both analogue and
															digital, and could be connected to relays or
															sensors depending on voltage, to remove
															manufacturer limitations. This would allow for
															vehicle customisation such as, anti-lag, throttle
															blipping, launch control, drive-by-wire, and
															wireless steering-wheel controls, while still
															being modular so the end user would only need to
															purchase the functions that they require.<br />

<br /><h3> Motivation </h3>

I believe there is demand for a product that can act as a ECU and BCU module
that can be used in motorsport and tuning applications. There are several
companies, for example; Motec(1), Haltec(2), Link(3), AEM(4) & several others
that already make engine management systems. There are also several companies
such as Cartek(5) and Summit Racing(6) that make BCU’s and Wireless Steering
wheel control systems but (with the exception of Motec) there are no ‘out of the
box’ single supplier options that are affordable at a grass roots level. Motec
currently make an all-in-one bus system for their ECU’s, but it is not
affordable for most grass roots teams, with the Motec M142 GPR Pro with Logging
unit retailing at $6841 USD(7) without firmware, a screen or any additional features like
shift controllers and sensors packages.<br />

<br /><h3>Description</h3>

My product would integrate features of a normal ECU and a normal Car BCU into
several smaller units. It is important that it has the ability to perform all
the standard motorsport requirements as this would be the target market. Phase 1
would only support petrol & E85, with a max of 8 cylinders running direct
injections.<br /> It would also require:<br /> •	Anti-lag<br /> •	Auto throttle
blip (for full throttle shifting)<br /> •	Drive by wire<br /> •	Flex-fuel
support<br /> •	Knock detection<br /> •	Launch control<br /> •	Paddle shift
support<br /> •	Speed limiting<br /> •	Traction control<br /> •	Variable cam
control<br /> •	Wasted spark and sequential ignition<br /><br /> Some of these
would be in the base unit, whilst others like drive-by-wire would be an optional
extra that makes use of the in-car network. Additionally, it would require a
second module for the digital and analog inputs and outputs to drive relays and
BCU features.<br /> I foresee the unit consisting of multiple small units that
can be networked together to create a whole system, so that an end user could
buy the components that they need, rather than the current all or nothing
approach taken by many ecu manufacturers. This would also allow for the
manufacturer to add and remove featured based on demand without re-engineering
the entire product, helping with life cycle and compatibility issues.<br /><br
/> The product would be able to be installed with off the shelf ethernet cables
running at 1Gbps, but would come with the recommendation to use ruggedized
cables in environmentally exposed areas. By using established communication
cabling and not relying on proprietary ones, this allows for more modularity and
for easy urgent repairs when parts fail. It would also mean the initial purchase
of this system would be a lot cheaper as a customer could purchase the ECU and
then add features they want in a customizable system that is currently not
available. My BCU module would control everything from headlights, indicators,
wipers, electronic differentials and any non-engine system on the car including
the provision for solid state engine and fuel kill switches, and fire management
systems, all from the wireless steering wheel controls. This would eliminate
cabling issues and wire failure due to constant movement of the steering wheel.
This is a common cause of failure in current technology and my product will
eliminate this problem. This would most likely be handled over either Bluetooth
or 802.11bgn. Current rally cars already utilize Wi-Fi to assist with tracking,
so building a system that could integrate the Wi-Fi would also require less
duplication and save weight. The system would run a primary output device such
as an android or apple tablet connected via USB or Wi-Fi. This would allow the
user to both view and change settings easily without the need to get out a
dedicated pc just to tune the car. This could also be expanded to include a
second output for the navigator that could show the current GPS location and
other navigator specific information for use in rallying. This would further
improve cost viability because rather than using specialised custom made LCD
sceens, the end user could use off the shelf products and just download the app.
Then the devices could be mounted in the vehicle using RAM mounts (which are
already FIA approved) for that exact application meaning less custom
engineering. </p> </div>
