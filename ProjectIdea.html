															<p> <h2>Project Idea <br /> Modular ECU / BCU for
															Motorsport<br /></h2> <h3>Overview</h3>My project
															is to create a modular ECU (engine control unit)
															/BCU (body control unit) to improve affordability
															for entry level competitors in motorsport, while
															being scalable for more advanced motorsport teams.
															This would be used for performance tuning
															applications. The device would support having
															multiple inputs and outputs of both analogue and
															digital, and could be connected to relays or
															sensors depending on need, to remove manufacturer
															limitations. This would allow for vehicle
															customisation such as, anti-lag, throttle
															blipping, launch control, drive-by-wire, and
															wireless steering-wheel controls, while still
															being modular so the end user would only need to
															purchase the functions that they require.<br />

<br /><h3> Motivation</h3>

I believe there is demand for a product that can act as an ECU and BCU module
that can be used in motorsport and tuning applications. There are several
companies, for example; Motec, Haltec, Link, AEM & several others that already
make engine management systems. There are also several companies such as Cartek
and Summit Racing that make BCU’s and Wireless Steering wheel control systems
but (with the exception of Motec) there are no ‘out of the box’ single supplier
options that are affordable at a grass roots level. Motec currently make an
all-in-one bus system for their ECU’s, but it is not affordable for most grass
roots teams, with the <b><i>Motec M142 GPR Pro with Logging</i></b> unit retailing at $6,841
USD without firmware, a screen or any additional features like shift controllers and
sensors packages.<br />

<br /><h3>Description</h3>

My product would integrate features of a normal ECU and a normal Car BCU into
several smaller units. It is important that it has the ability to perform all
the standard motorsport requirements as this would be the target market. Phase 1
would only support petrol & E85, with a max of 8 cylinders running direct
injection. <br /> It would need to support: <br /> •	Anti-lag <br /> •	Auto
throttle blip (for full throttle shifting) <br /> •	Drive by wire <br /> •
Flex-fuel support<br /> •	Knock detection <br /> •	Launch control<br /> •	Paddle
shift support<br /> •	Speed limiting<br /> •	Traction control <br /> •	Variable
cam control<br /> •	Wasted spark and sequential ignition <br /><br /> Some of
these would be in the base unit, whilst others like drive-by-wire would be an
optional extra that makes use of the in-car network. Additionally, it would
require a second module for the digital and analog inputs and outputs to drive
relays and BCU features.<br /><br /> I foresee the unit consisting of multiple
small units that can be networked together to create a whole system, so that an
end user could buy the components that they need, rather than the current all or
nothing approach taken by many ECU manufacturers. This would also allow for the
manufacturer to add and remove features based on demand without re-engineering
the entire product, helping with life cycle and compatibility issues. <br /><br
/> The product would be able to be installed with off the shelf standard
ethernet cables running at 1Gbps, but would come with the recommendation to use
ruggedized cables in environmentally exposed areas. By using established
communication cabling and not relying on proprietary ones, this allows for more
modularity and for easy urgent repairs when parts fail. It would also mean the
initial purchase of this system would be a lot cheaper as a customer could
purchase the ECU and then add the features they want in a customizable system.
My BCU module would control everything from headlights, indicators, wipers,
electronic differentials and any non-engine system on the car. This includes the
provision for solid state engine and fuel kill switches, and fire management
systems, all from the wireless steering wheel controls. This would eliminate
cabling issues and wire failure due to constant movement of the steering wheel.
This is a common point of failure in current low cost options and my product will
eliminate this problem. This would most likely be implemented over Bluetooth or
802.11bgn. Current rally cars already utilize Wi-Fi to assist with tracking, so
building a system that could integrate the Wi-Fi would also require less
duplication and save weight. The system would run a primary output device such
as an android or apple tablet connected via USB or Wi-Fi. This would allow the
user to both view and change settings easily without the need to get out a
dedicated pc just to tune the car. This could also be expanded to include a
second output for the navigator that could show the current GPS location and
other navigator specific information for use in rallying. This would further
improve cost viability, because rather than using specialised custom made LCD
screens, the end user could use a tablet and just download the app. Then the
devices could be mounted in the vehicle using RAM mounts (which are already FIA
approved) meaning less custom engineering. </p>

<br /><h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>

The project would require the creation of two applications. The first
application would be the GUI (graphic user interface) for the end user. This
would be in the form of an android/apple app so that it could work on a tablet.
This would allow for customizable views to monitor engine data and display dash
information.<br /><br /> The second application would be installed on the ECU
hardware and would respond to the various inputs and outputs to control the
engine as a modern ECU functions. This would also include networking systems so
that it can link with the additional modules.<br /><br /> Lastly there would be
a number of different units that can all connect by ethernet cables:<br /> •
Main ECU and Engine Module<br /> •	Paddle-shift Module<br /> •	Body Control
Module <br /> •	Drive-by-wire actuator and potentiometer Modules<br /> •	Boost
Control Module<br /><br />

<br /><h3> Skills Required</h3> I would require someone with extensive
programing knowledge in C++ to both make the application and write the software
for the individual units. There are already many networking options available on
the market that the end user could self-source. The main hardware would need to
be made using a microprocessor board with an expansion board that could handle
the required inputs and outputs, averaging 20 of each. This would need to be
sourced or made and would be one of the most significant expenses for the
project, as reliability of the ECU/BCU will be very important. <br />

<br /><h3> Outcome</h3> My project will create a product that is scalable,
reliable and available to more of the market than ever before. Customers would
be able to start with an initial small investment and as they develop their
cars, purchase ‘off the shelf’ additional modules and install them with little
technical support. This would garner market share and make it a lot easier for
people to enter a sport that is increasingly becoming very expensive to compete
in and increase the participation at the grass-roots level. <br />
