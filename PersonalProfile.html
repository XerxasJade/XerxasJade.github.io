				<p> <h2>Online Personality Tests:<br /><br /> Test 1 - Truity
				Personality Test<i>(1)</i><br /></h2>ENTP - The Inventor<br /> ENTPs are
				inspired innovators, motivated to find new solutions to intellectually
				challenging problems. They are curious and clever, and seek to
				comprehend the people, systems, and principles that surround them. <br
				/> </p>

 <p> <h2>Test 2 - 16 Personalitys Test<i>(2)</i><br /></h2>INFP-T Mediator<br />
 Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good
 in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things
 better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators
 have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the
 population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the
 Mediator personality type – but when they find like-minded people to spend
 their time with, the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and
 inspiration. <br /> </p>

<p> <h2>Test 3 - Learning Style Test<i>(3)</i><br /></h2>Auditory/Tactile<br />
Auditory: 35%<br /> Visual: 30%<br /> Tactile: 35%<br /> If you are an auditory
learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things
you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an
easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn
by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.
As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you
become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may
be hearing and understanding everything being said. <br /><br /> If you are a
tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember
things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to
touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when
some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take
frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may
have difficulty sitting still. As a tactile learner, you like to take things
apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move
around when you become bored. <br /> </p>
