											<p> <h2>Ideal Job <br /> Infrastucture Automation
											Consultant - Defence<br /><br /> Job Advertisement </h2>
											As part of researching for this assignment I found the
											role of Infrastructure Automation Consultant for the
											Defense department. As Linked Below:</p> <a
											href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41076722?type=standard#searchRequestToken=0906a88d-57f7-436c-bda7-6341d01397ba">Infrastructure
											Automation Consultant - Defence<br /></a> <p><br /></p>
											<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <img
											src="images/job.jpg" style="width: 479px; height: 858px;"
											/>

											</div>

											<p> <h2>Job Description<br /></h2> The position of
											Infrastructure Automation Consultants for defense would
											presumably be based on providing standard infrastructure
											automation such as reducing or removing human interaction
											with critical IT systems to improve repeatability and
											limit human error. Things that currently use IT automation
											include cloud computing, system provisioning and
											application deployment such as remote loading operating
											systems. This would be especially challenging for defense
											as they may be using a lot of custom noncommercial
											technology and may have additional security and safety
											requirements. Working with defense could be very different
											from working with normal companies as presumably they have
											different priorities around reliability, repeatability and
											redundancy. I think working as defense contractor would be
											a great opportunity.<br /> </p>

										<p> <h2>Job Required Skills and Experiance<br /></h2> In
										addition to the normal IT requirements because this role is
										for Defense it also requires a minimum of NV1 (Negative
										Vetting 1) defense clearance, if you cannot qualify for NV1
										or higher the IT requirements don’t matter. In addition to
										requiring NV1, you need experience working with VMware
										(Virtual machines) as well as experience with Windows Server
										10 & PowerShell which are both Microsoft applications.
										Lastly, they are also looking for someone with experience in
										Splunk. According to the Splunk website it is a big data
										infrastructure security system that gives you insights into
										operational performance.<br /> </p>

									<p> <h2>Job My Skills and Experiance<br /></h2> I currently
									have very few skills for this job, I have a basic grounding in
									the windows server platform from previous training on Server
									2008 and Server 2012. I have a basic understanding of
									PowerShell based on work I have done previously but very
									limited practical experience with Windows 10. I would need to
									upskill significantly to get back to an productive level in
									both Windows Serve & PowerShell. I have had extensive training
									and practice using VMWare as part of learning to install and
									implement Cisco Prime and other networking devices such as
									radius servers which are commonly are installed on VM’s to
									avoid needing multiple physical devices. I have no experience
									with Splunk and would need training in that. Importantly
									however I have a current NV1 clearance so that is one major
									hurdle already take care of.<br /> </p>

								<p> <h2>Job My Plan to get the Skills and Experiance<br /></h2>
								My plan to get this job begins with completing my Degree, as
								part of the dree I will hopefully pick up experience with many
								of the core skills I need. Once my degree is finished I would
								look for a position that would also involve automation –
								preferably using windows 10 to increase my experience in that
								area, while doing this I would look into either furthering my
								training with additional courses either though Uni or through
								companies liker DDLS to gain additional skills in PowerShell, &
								Server 10 I would also (time permitting) in parallel to my
								current studies begin looking into the Certification tracks for
								Splunk. Splunk offer several online training paths for different
								areas of expertise IE: Power User, Admin, Architect, Developer &
								Security etc. Their entry level courses are free and once
								completed I would hopefully have enough knowledge about the
								program to know what additional courses I should take. Hopefully
								I would be able to get a position after graduating that would
								allow me to build on these skills as well so that after gaining
								industry experience using these told I would then be able to
								apply for the position. Additionally while studying, and gaining
								the skills for this position I would need to maintain my NV1
								status so when I do leave my current role I would need to find
								other roles that also involve defense work so that my clearance
								would not expire. It also would be worthwhile upgrading to a NV2
								as the NV1 is a minimum requirement and upgrading to NV2 is
								something that I hope to do in the future. <br /> </p> </div>
